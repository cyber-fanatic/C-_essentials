# Cpp_essentials
**In this repository i understand the basic  concepts of  C++ programming language that are helpful for learning other programming languages like Python and Java etc.** 

**identifier :**
- An identifier in C++ is a name used to identify a variable, function, class,object or other user-defined items in your code. Identifiers are made up of letters, digits, and underscores, 
  must begin with a letter or underscore, and cannot be a reserved keyword.<br>
  <h1>namespace std :</h1>
- The namespace std is a specific namespace in C++ that contains all the identifiers (**such as classes, functions, and objects**) defined in the C++ Standard Library.<br>
**Example :**<br>

<h1>preprocessor directive :</h1>
A preprocessor directive is a command in programming, particularly in languages like C and C++, that provides instructions to the compiler before the actual compilation begins. These directives start with a # symbol and are used for various purposes, including:
