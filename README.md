**In this repository i understand the basic  concepts of  C++ programming language that are helpful for learning other programming languages like Python and Java etc.** 

**identifier :**
An identifier in C++ is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, or other user-defined items in your code. Identifiers are made up of letters, digits, and underscores, must begin with a letter or underscore, and cannot be a reserved keyword.
**namespace std :**
The namespace std is a specific namespace in C++ that contains all the identifiers (**such as classes, functions, and objects**) defined in the C++ Standard Library.
**Example :**
By using namespace std, we can access these components without needing to prefix them with **std::** . For example, instead of writing **std::cout**, we can simply write **cout** if we included **using namespace std;**.
